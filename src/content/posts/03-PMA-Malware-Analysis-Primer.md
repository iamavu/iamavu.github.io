# Malware Analysis Primer

## Goals of Malware Analysis

- To determine what exactly has happened to ensure that you’ve located all infected machines and files and then develop signatures (host and network)
- **Types of signatures**
    - Host based are used to detect malicious code on victim computers by identifying created or modified files by malware
    - Network based are used to detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic
- Finally we figure out how the malware works

## Malware Analysis Techniques

- Types of techniques
    - **Static Analysis**
        - Examining the executable
        - Reverse engineering the malware’s internals by disassembling it and looking at it’s instructions
    - **Dynamic Analysis**
        - Running the malware and examining its behavior in order to remove it’s infection and create signatures
        - Quite often we use debugger to understand how malware is being
- Types of Malware
    - Backdoor —> Malicious code that is installed and allows attacker to gain access to local system with little or no authentication
    - Botnet —> Similar to backdoor but it allows attacker to send command from a central command-and-control (C2) server
    - Downloader —> Malicious code which downloads additional malicious code
    - Information stealing malware —> Malware which steals sensitive data from victim’s computer and sends it to attacker
    - Launcher —> Used to launch other malicious programs
    - Rootkit —> Code designed to hide other malicious programs
    - Scareware —> Designed to frighten the user into buying “software”
    - Span-Sending Malware —> Sends spam allowing attackers to generate income by that process
    - Worm or Virus —> Code that can copy itself and infect additional computers
- Tips and Tricks
    - Focus on key features rather than dissecting every details as malware is a complex piece of software
    - Try analyzing malware with different approaches and angles using different tools, don’t get stuck on one
    - Recognize, understand and defeat the new and approaching techniques written by malware authors on the fly
